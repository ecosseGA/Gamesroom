You mentioned favorites/ratings didn't work, but here are other enhancements that could work:

1. Game Collections/Categories
Instead of individual favorites, create themed collections:

"Quick 5-Minute Games"
"Multiplayer Games"
"Puzzle Masters"
"Arcade Classics"

Users browse by collection, you curate the lists.

2. "Recently Played" Tracker

Cookies/localStorage to track last 10 games played
Shows on sidebar or dashboard
No database needed!
"Continue playing..." section

3. Play Count & Trending

Simple counter: increment on each game load
"Most Played This Week" widget
"Trending Now" section
Just needs one column added to games table

6. Game Search/Filter

7. Quick-Play Widget

8. Game Achievements (Simple Version)
